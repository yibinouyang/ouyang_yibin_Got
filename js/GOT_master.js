		[`STARK`, `House Stark of Winterfell is a Great House of Westeros,ruling over the vast region known as 
		the North from their seat in Winterfell.It is one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility by 
		far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. Before the Targaryen 
		conquest, as well as during the War of the Five Kings and Daenerys Targaryen's invasion of Westeros,
		the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North.`],

		[`BARATHEON`, `House Baratheon of Storm's End is a legally extinct Great House of Westeros. A cadet 
	branch was formerly the royal house, but House Lannister now controls the throne. House Baratheon 
	traditionally ruled the Stormlands on the eastern coast of Westeros, aptly named for its frequent 
	storms, from their seat of Storm's End.`],

		[`LANNISTER`, `House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros, one of its 
	richest and most powerful families and oldest dynasties. It is also the current royal house of the 
	Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon of King's Landing, which had been their 
	puppet house anyway.`],

		[`GREYJOY`, `House Greyjoy of Pyke is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It rules over the Iron Islands,
	 a harsh and bleak collection of islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the castle at Pyke. 
	 The head of the house is the Lord Reaper of Pyke.
	House Greyjoy's sigil is traditionally a golden kraken on a black field. Their house words are "We Do Not 
	Sow," although the phrase "What Is Dead May Never Die" is also closely associated with House Greyjoy and 
	their bannermen, as they are associated with the faith of the Drowned God. `],

		[`TULLY`, `House Tully of Riverrun is an exiled Great House of Westeros. Its most senior member carried
	 the title of Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident, until the Red Wedding. The current head 
	 is Lord Edmure Tully, son of the late Hoster Tully. The Tully sigil is a silver trout on a red and blue 
	 background. Their house words are "Family, Duty, Honor.`],

		[`ARRYN`, `House Arryn of the Eyrie is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It has ruled over the Vale 
	 Arryn for millennia, originally as the Kings of Mountain and Vale and more recently as Lords Paramount
	  of the Vale and Wardens of the East under the Targaryen kings and Baratheon-Lannister kings. The nominal 
	  ad of House Arryn is Robin Arryn, the Lord of the Eyrie, with his stepfather Petyr Baelish acting as Lord
	   Protector until he reaches the age of majority. `],

		[`TARGERYEN`, `House Targaryen of Dragonstone is a Great House of Westeros and was the ruling royal House 
	of the Seven Kingdoms for three centuries since it conquered and unified the realm, before it was deposed
	 during Robert's Rebellion and House Baratheon replaced it as the new royal House. The few surviving 
	 Targaryens fled into exile to the Free Cities of Essos across the Narrow Sea. Currently based on 
	 Dragonstone off of the eastern coast of Westeros, House Targaryen seeks to retake the Seven Kingdoms 
	 from House Lannister, who formally replaced House Baratheon as the royal House following the destruction 
	 of the Great Sept of Baelor.`],

		[`FREY`, `House Frey of the Twins was the Great House of the Riverlands, having gained their position 
	 or their treachery against their former liege lords, House Tully, who were stripped of all their lands 
	 and titles for their rebellion against the Iron Throne; House Tully had supported the independence movement 
	 for the Kingdom of the North. The current head of the house is unknown following the assassinations 
	 	of Lord Walder Frey and two of his sons, Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers, by the vengeful Arya Stark. 
	 This is made more complex by the subsequent assassination of all the male Freys soon after.`],
